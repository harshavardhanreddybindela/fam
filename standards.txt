To improve the structure and readability of your Flask application according to industry standards, follow these guidelines and practices:

1. **Separate Configuration**: Keep configuration settings separate and load them based on the environment (development, production, etc.). Use environment variables for sensitive information.

2. **Blueprints for Routing**: Use Flask Blueprints to organize your application into distinct components, each with its own set of routes.

3. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Structure**: Organize your application using the MVC pattern, separating the data access logic (Model), route handling logic (Controller), and presentation logic (View).

4. **Error Handling**: Implement global error handlers for common HTTP errors and application-specific errors.

5. **Logging**: Use logging to track events that happen during the execution of your application, especially in production.

6. **Comments and Docstrings**: Use comments sparingly for complex logic explanations and docstrings for modules, classes, and functions to explain their purpose and usage.

7. **Code Formatting and Linting**: Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Use tools like `flake8` for linting and `black` for code formatting to maintain code quality.

8. **Security Practices**: Ensure security practices such as using environment variables for sensitive data (like database credentials), validating and sanitizing input, and handling authentication and authorization properly.

Here's an organized and refactored snippet of your `app.py`, applying some of the above principles:

```python
# app.py
# Import standard libraries
import os
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for

# Import Flask extensions
from flask_mail import Mail
from flask_session import Session

# Import application components
from config import Config
from models import db
from routes import main, auth, student

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

# Initialize extensions
db.init_app(app)
mail = Mail(app)
Session(app)

# Register Blueprints
app.register_blueprint(main.bp)
app.register_blueprint(auth.bp, url_prefix='/auth')
app.register_blueprint(student.bp, url_prefix='/student')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this refactored example:
- The application configuration is loaded from a separate `Config` class, which can be tailored based on the environment.
- Routes and business logic are organized into Blueprints (`main`, `auth`, `student`), making the code modular and easier to maintain.
- The Flask extensions like `Mail` and `Session` are initialized with the app object.

Now, let's look at a simplified structure for your Flask project:

```
/flask_app
    /app
        __init__.py
        /config
            __init__.py
            config.py
        /models
            __init__.py
            models.py
        /routes
            __init__.py
            main.py
            auth.py
            student.py
        /templates
        /static
    app.py
    requirements.txt
```

This structure follows the MVC pattern and organizes your application into clear, distinct areas, making it easier to manage and scale. Each component of your application (auth, student management, etc.) can have its own Blueprint, model, and templates if needed.

- **/app/config/config.py**: Contains settings for different environments.
- **/app/models/models.py**: Contains SQLAlchemy models.
- **/app/routes/auth.py**: Contains authentication routes.
- **/app/routes/student.py**: Contains routes related to student operations.
- **/app/routes/main.py**: Contains general routes like home, about, contact.
