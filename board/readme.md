1. **Flask Framework and Python**
Understanding of Flask: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Compared to Django, Flask provides more flexibility and is considered more Pythonic. It allows developers to choose their tools and libraries.

Routing: In Flask, routes are used to map URLs to view functions in your application. These view functions then return the response to the user. Flask uses decorators to define routes. Understanding how to use variables in routes and how to construct URLs dynamically is crucial.

Templates and Views: Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to render templates. Be familiar with the syntax of Jinja2, including variable filters, template inheritance, and control structures. Explain the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and how Flask views act as the controller, mediating between models and templates.

Forms and Requests: Know how to handle form submissions using request.form and file uploads with request.files in Flask. Discuss validating form data and the importance of CSRF protection.

Sessions and User Authentication: Explain how Flask manages user sessions to keep users logged in between requests. Discuss Flask extensions like Flask-Login for user authentication and how to secure user passwords using hash functions.

Database Interaction: Describe how to use Flask with SQL databases using raw SQL queries or an ORM like SQLAlchemy. Understand creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from the database.

Flask Extensions: Flaskâ€™s functionality is extended with "extensions" that add additional functionality to a Flask application. Examples include Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, Flask-Migrate for database migrations, and Flask-Mail for sending emails.

2. **Web Development Fundamentals**
HTTP Protocol: HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Understanding HTTP methods (GET for retrieving resources, POST for submitting data), status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), and the overall request-response cycle is essential.

Client-Server Architecture: This is the fundamental structure that underlies all web communication. The client sends a request to the server, which processes the request and returns a response. Web applications act as intermediaries between the client (usually a web browser) and the database.

Front-end Technologies: Even if your focus is on backend development, understanding the basics of HTML (structure of web pages), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity) is necessary, as these technologies are often integrated into Flask applications through templates.

RESTful Services: RESTful APIs are designed around the use of standard HTTP verbs and URIs to interact with resources. Understanding how to design and implement a RESTful API with Flask is a valuable skill.

3. **Database Knowledge**
SQL vs. NoSQL: SQL databases are relational, table-based databases, whereas NoSQL databases are document, key-value, wide-column, or graph databases. Each has its use cases, with SQL being more structured and NoSQL offering more flexibility and scalability.

ORMs: An ORM allows developers to interact with a database using high-level entities such as classes rather than SQL queries. SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM in the Flask ecosystem. Understanding how to define models, query data, and perform migrations is crucial.

4. **Security Considerations**
Secure Password Handling: Storing passwords securely is non-negotiable. Hashing passwords using algorithms like bcrypt or argon2, with a salt, ensures that even if data is compromised, the passwords are not easily cracked.

Input Validation and Sanitization: Preventing SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks involves validating and sanitizing user input, using prepared statements for database access, and incorporating tokens in forms.

Session Security: Use HTTPS for secure communication, set secure cookies, and implement timeout mechanisms for sessions. Understand Flaskâ€™s built-in session management and how to configure it for security.

5. **Testing and Deployment**
Unit and Integration Testing: Unit tests focus on individual components, while integration tests cover interactions between components. Use frameworks like pytest or unittest for testing Flask applications.

Deployment Practices: Familiarize yourself with deploying Flask applications to different environments. Understand WSGI servers like Gunicorn, containerization with Docker, and services like Heroku or AWS.

6. **Soft Skills and Problem-Solving**
Debugging Skills: Share techniques and tools you use for debugging Flask applications, such as logging, debugging extensions, or IDE features.

Version Control: Version control systems, especially Git, are integral to modern web development workflows. Be prepared to discuss how you use version control in your projects.

Continuous Learning: The tech field is always evolving. Express your commitment to learning, how you stay updated with new technologies, and your adaptability to change.

7. **Personal Experience**
Project Discussions: Be ready to talk about specific projects, focusing on your contributions, the technologies used, and the outcomes. Highlight any Flask-specific features you implemented.

Code Refactoring: Discuss instances where you improved the performance, readability, or maintainability of your codebase. This could involve optimizing database queries, implementing design patterns, or simplifying complex code segments.
